Programming in Lua 3
====================

[Programming in Lua](http://lua.org/pil) by Robert Ierusalimschy is the authorative book about [the language](http://lua.org). The third edition of the book has exercises at the end of each chapter, this repository contains my solutions to these exercises and will be updated as I read the book. There is one folder for each chapter in the book, in the format `<chapter number><chapter name>`. I also try to add examples of the code/syntax introduced in each chapter (in the `examples` folder of each chapter) and some notes (in `notes.txt`).

Buying the Book
---------------

There is an [online version](http://lua.org/pil) of this book, however I do advise you to buy it if you want to learn the language, both to support the author and since a paper copy is advantageous when learning. If you do not need a paper copy you can still but the [ebook version](http://store.feistyduck.com/products/programming-in-lua).
