- The *eight-queen puzzle* is solved with a configuration of eight
  queens on a chessboard in a way that no queen can attack another
  one
    - Any valid solution must have exactly one queen in each row
    - No two queens can be in the same column
    - No two queens can be directly diagonal to each other
- A *Markov-chain algorithm* can be used to generate pseudo-random
  text based on what words can follow a sequence of n previous words
  in a base text
- The resulting text is very, but not quite, random
