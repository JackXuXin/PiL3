Exercise 4.3: Many people argue that repeat-until is sldom used, and therefore
it should not be present in a minimalistic language like Lua. What do you
think?

A repeat-until loop is similar to a do-while loop in C and it's derivatives
because the loop's contents are run once before the condition is evaluated.
This behavior is not used too often, but sometimes it's needed. You can
simulate such a loop with a while loop, but doing so is awkward and doesn't
tell the reader of the code right away what you intend the loop to do, so I do
think that such a construction has it's place in Lua.
