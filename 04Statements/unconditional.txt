Example 4.2: Describe four different ways to write an unconditional loop in
Lua. Which one do you prefer?

I prefer the while loop because it instantly shows what you are trying to do:
loop until the conditional `true` becomes false, and it never will, so the
loop will go on forever. 
The version with repeat-until is also quite readable, but since the condition
is at the bottom, one can't immediately see that it's an unconditional loop if
the loop's body is big.
The for loop is not very readable, because the reader would wonder what
`math.huge` is, or why we would loop that many times
The goto loop is not very good either because there might be programmers that
don't know about gotos and labels, so they will be confused by it, and while
it works, it doesn't immediately suggest that it's an infinite loop.
