Exercise 1.3
============

> Can you think of other languages that use
> `--` for comments?

I know that there are some languages that use
really esoteric comments, like the `REM` in
DOS batch files or the `;` from LISPs (this
comes from LISP, doesn't it?), however I have
not yet come across another language that
uses two hyphens to denote comments.
