Exercise 21.2: The patterns "%D" and "[^%d]" are equivalent.
What about the patterns "[^%d%u]" and "[%D%U]"?

The pattern "%D" matches anything that is not a digit,
the lower-case version, "%d" matches anything that is
a digit but it's negated by the caret "[^%d]". This is why
the two are equivalent.

However, the patterns "[^%d%u]" and "[%D%U]" are not
equivalent. The pattern "[%D%U]" will match anything
that is EITHER not a digit or anything that is not
an upper-case letter, meaning that in fact it will
match anything (all digits are not upper-case letters
and all upper-case letters are not digits).
The pattern "[^%d%u]", on the other hand, matches
anything that is not a digit AND not an upper-case
letter.
